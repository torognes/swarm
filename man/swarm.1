.SH DESCRIPTION
Environmental or clinical molecular studies generate large volumes of
amplicons (e.g., 16S or 18S SSU-rRNA sequences) that need to be
clustered into molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Common
clustering methods are based on greedy, input-order dependent
algorithms, with arbitrary selection of global cluster size and
cluster centroids. To address that problem, we developed \fBswarm\fR,
a fast and robust method that recursively groups amplicons with
\fId\fR or less differences. \fBswarm\fR produces natural and stable
clusters centered on local peaks of abundance, mostly free from
input-order dependency induced by centroid selection.
.PP
Exact clustering is impractical on large data sets when using a naïve
all-vs-all approach (more precisely a 2-combination without
repetitions), as it implies unrealistic numbers of pairwise
comparisons. \fBswarm\fR is based on a maximum number of differences
\fId\fR between two amplicons, and focuses only on very close local
relationships. For \fId\fR = 1 (default value), swarm uses an
algorithm of linear complexity that generates all possible single
mutations and performs exact-string matching by comparing
hash-values. For \fId\fR = 2 or greater, swarm uses an algorithm of
quadratic complexity that performs pairwise string comparisons. An
efficient \fIk\fR-mer-based filtering and an astute use of comparisons
results obtained during the clustering process allows to avoid most of
the amplicon comparisons needed in a naïve approach. To speed up the
remaining amplicon comparisons, \fBswarm\fR implements an extremely
fast Needleman-Wunsch algorithm making use of the Streaming SIMD
Extensions (SSE2) of modern x86-64 CPUs. If SSE2 instructions are not
available, \fBswarm\fR exits with an error message.
.PP
\fBswarm\fR reads the named input \fIfilename\fR, a fasta file of
nucleotide amplicons. The amplicon identifier is defined as the string
comprised between the ">" symbol and the first space or the end of the
line, whichever comes first. As \fBswarm\fR outputs lists of amplicon
identifiers, amplicon identifiers must be unique to avoid ambiguity;
swarm exits with an error message if identifiers are not
unique. Amplicon identifiers must end with a "_" followed by a
positive integer representing the amplicon copy number (or abundance
annotation; usearch/vsearch users can use the option \-z to change
that behavior). Abundance annotations play a crucial role in the
clustering process, and swarm exits with an error message if that
information is not available. The amplicon sequence is defined as a
string of [acgt] or [acgu] symbols (case insensitive), starting after
the end of the identifier line and ending before the next identifier
line or the file end; \fBswarm\fR exits with an error message if any
other symbol is present.

.SS General options
.TP 9
.B \-h\fP,\fB\ \-\-help
display this help and exit.
.TP
.BI \-t\fP,\fB\ \-\-threads\~ "positive integer"
number of computation threads to use. Values between 1 and 256 are
accepted, but we recommend to use a number of threads lesser or equal
to the number of available CPU cores. Default number of threads is 1.
.TP
.B \-v\fP,\fB\ \-\-version

.SS Clustering options
.TP 9
.BI \-d\fP,\fB\ \-\-differences\~ "zero or positive integer"
maximum number of differences allowed between two amplicons, meaning
that two amplicons will be grouped if they have \fIinteger\fR (or
less) differences. This is \fBswarm\fR's most important parameter. The
number of differences is calculated as the number of mismatches
(substitutions, insertions or deletions) between the two amplicons
once the optimal pairwise global alignment has been found (see
"pairwise alignment advanced options" to influence that step). Any
\fIinteger\fR between 0 and 256 can be used, but high \fId\fR values
will decrease the taxonomical resolution of \fBswarm\fR
results. Commonly used \fId\fR values are 1, 2 or 3, rarely
higher. When using \fId\fR = 0, \fBswarm\fR will output results
corresponding to a strict dereplication of the dataset, i.e. merging
identical amplicons. Warning, whatever the \fId\fR value, \fBswarm\fR
requires fasta entries to present abundance values. Default number of
differences is 1.
.TP
.B \-n\fP,\fB\ \-\-no\-otu\-breaking
deactivate the built-in OTU refinement (not recommended). Amplicon
abundance values are used to identify transitions among in-contact
OTUs and to separate them, yielding higher-resolution clustering
results. That option prevents that separation, and in practice, allows
the creation of a link between amplicons A and B, even if the
abundance of B is higher than the abundance of A.
.LP
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS Fastious options
.TP 9
.BI \-b\fP,\fB\ \-\-boundary\~ "positive integer"
when using the option \-\-fastidious (\-f), define the minimum mass of
a \fIlarge\fR OTU. By default, an OTU with a mass of 3 or more is
considered large. Conversely, an OTU is small if it has a mass of less
than 3, meaning that it is composed of either one amplicon of
abundance 2, or two amplicons of abundance 1. Any positive value
greater than 1 can be specified. Using higher boundary values will
speed up the second pass, but also reduce the taxonomical resolution
of \fBswarm\fR results. Default mass of a large OTU is 3.
.TP
.BI \-c\fP,\fB\ \-\-ceiling\~ "positive integer"
when using the option \-\-fastidious (\-f), define \fBswarm\fR's
maximum memory footprint (in megabytes). \fBswarm\fR will adjust the
\-\-bloom\-bits (\-y) value of the Bloom filter to fit within the
specified amount of memory.
.TP
.B \-f\fP,\fB\ \-\-fastidious
when working with \fId\fR = 1, perform a second clustering pass to
reduce the number of small OTUs (recommended option). During the first
clustering pass, an intermediate amplicon can be missing for purely
stochastic reasons, interrupting the aggregation process. The
fastidious option will create virtual amplicons, allowing to graft
small OTUs upon bigger ones. By default, an OTU is small if it has a
mass of 2 or less (see the \-\-boundary option to modify that
value). To speed things up, \fBswarm\fR uses a Bloom filter to store
intermediate results. Warning, the second clustering pass can be 2 to
3 times slower than the first pass and requires much more memory to
store the virtual amplicons in Bloom filters. See the options
\-\-bloom\-bits (\-y) or \-\-ceiling (\-c) to control the memory
footprint of the Bloom filter. The fastidious option modifies
clustering results: the output files produced by the options \-\-log
(\-l), \-\-output\-file (\-o), \-\-mothur (\-r), \-\-uclust\-file, and
\-\-seeds (\-w) are updated to reflect these modifications; the file
\-\-statistics\-file (\-s) is partially updated (columns 6 and 7 are
not updated); the output file \-\-internal\-structure (\-i) is not
updated.
.TP
.BI \-y\fP,\fB\ \-\-bloom\-bits\~ "positive integer"
when using the option \-\-fastidious (\-f), define the size (in bits)
of each entry in the Bloom filter. That option allows to balance the
efficiency (i.e. speed) and the memory footprint of the Bloom
filter. Large values will make the Bloom filter more efficient but
will require more memory. Any value between 4 and 20 can be
used. Default value is 16. See the \-\-ceiling (\-c) option for an
alternative way to control the memory footprint.
.LP
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS Input/output options
.TP 9
.BI \-a\fP,\fB\ \-\-append\-abundance\~ "positive integer"
set abundance value to use when some or all amplicons in the input
file lack abundance values. Warning, it is not recommended to use
\fBswarm\fR on datasets where abundance values are all identical. We
provide that option as a courtesy to advanced users, please use it
carefully. \fBswarm\fR exits with an error message if abundance values
are missing and if this option is not used.

.RE
.RE
.TP
.BI \-l\fP,\fB\ \-\-log \0filename
output all messages to \fIfilename\fR instead of \fIstandard error\fR,
with the exception of error messages of course. That option is useful
in situations where writing to \fIstandard error\fR is problematic
(for example, with certain job schedulers).
.TP
.BI \-o\fP,\fB\ \-\-output\-file \0filename
output clustering results to \fIfilename\fR. Results consist of a list
of OTUs, one OTU per line. An OTU is a list of amplicon identifiers
separated by spaces. That output format can be modified by the option
\-\-mothur (\-r). Default is to write to standard output.
.TP

output clustering results in a format compatible with Mothur. That
option modifies \fBswarm\fR's default output format.

.IP \n+[step].
theoretical maximum radius of the OTU (i.e., number of cummulated
differences between the seed and the furthermost amplicon in the

.RE
.RE
.TP
.BI \-u\fP,\fB\ \-\-uclust\-file \0filename
output clustering results in uclust-like file format to the specified
file. That option does not modify \fBswarm\fR's default output format.
.TP
.BI \-w\fP,\fB\ \-\-seeds \0filename
output OTU representatives to \fIfilename\fR in fasta format. The
abundance value of each representative is the sum of the abundances of
all the amplicons in the OTU.
.TP
.B \-z\fP,\fB\ \-\-usearch\-abundance
accept amplicon abundance values in usearch/vsearch's style
(>label;size=\fIinteger\fR[;]). That option influences the abundance
annotation style used in output files.

.SS Pairwise alignment advanced options
when using \fId\fR > 1, \fBswarm\fR recognizes advanced command-line
options modifying the pairwise global alignment scoring parameters:
.RS
.TP 9
.BI \-m\fP,\fB\ \-\-match\-reward\~ "positive integer"
Default reward for a nucleotide match is 5.
.TP
.BI \-p\fP,\fB\ \-\-mismatch\-penalty\~ "positive integer"
Default penalty for a nucleotide mismatch is 4.
.TP

Default gap opening penalty is 12.
.TP
.BI \-e\fP,\fB\ \-\-gap\-extension\-penalty\~ "positive integer"
Default gap extension penalty is 4.
.LP
.RE
As \fBswarm\fR focuses on close relationships (e.g., \fId\fR = 2 or
3), clustering results are resilient to pairwise alignment model
parameters modifications. Modifying model parameters has a stronger
impact when clustering using a higher \fId\fR value.

.SH VERSION HISTORY
New features and important modifications of \fBswarm\fR (short lived
or minor bug releases are not mentioned):
.RS
.TP
.BR v2.1.8\~ "released March 11, 2016"
Version 2.1.8 fixes a rare bug triggered when clustering extremely
short undereplicated sequences. Also, alignment parameters are not
shown when \fId\fR = 1.
.TP
.BR v2.1.7\~ "released February 24, 2016"
Version 2.1.7 fixes a bug in the output of seeds with the \-w option
when \fId\fR > 1 that was not properly fixed in version 2.1.6. It also
handles ascii character n°13 (CR) in FASTA files better. Swarm will
now exit with status 0 if the \-h or the \-v option is specified. The
help text and some error messages have been improved.
.TP
.BR v2.1.6\~ "released December 14, 2015"
Version 2.1.6 fixes problems with older compilers that do not have the
x86intrin.h header file. It also fixes a bug in the output of seeds
with the \-w option when \fId\fR > 1.
.TP
.BR v2.1.5\~ "released September 8, 2015"
Version 2.1.5 fixes minor bugs.
.TP
.BR v2.1.4\~ "released September 4, 2015"
Version 2.1.4 fixes minor bugs in the swarm algorithm used for \fId\fR
= 1.
.TP
.BR v2.1.3\~ "released August 28, 2015"
Version 2.1.3 adds checks of numeric option arguments.
.TP
.BR v2.1.1\~ "released March 31, 2015"
Version 2.1.1 fixes a bug with the fastidious option that caused it to
ignore some connections between large and small OTUs.
.TP
.BR v2.1.0\~ "released March 24, 2015"
Version 2.1.0 marks the first official release of swarm v2.
.TP
.BR v2.0.7\~ "released March 18, 2015"
Version 2.0.7 writes abundance information in usearch style when using
options \-w (\-\-seeds) in combination with \-z
(\-\-usearch\-abundance).
.TP
.BR v2.0.6\~ "released March 13, 2015"
Version 2.0.6 fixes a minor bug.
.TP
.BR v2.0.5\~ "released March 13, 2015"
Version 2.0.5 improves the implementation of the fastidious option and
adds options to control memory usage of the Bloom filter (\-y and
\-c).  In addition, an option (\-w) allows to output OTU
representatives sequences with updated abundances (sum of all
abundances inside each OTU). This version also enables \fBswarm\fR to
run with \fId\fR = 0.
.TP
.BR v2.0.4\~ "released March 6, 2015"
Version 2.0.4 includes a fully parallelised implementation of the
fastidious option.
.TP
.BR v2.0.3\~ "released March 4, 2015"
Version 2.0.3 includes a working implementation of the fastidious
option, but only the initial clustering is parallelized.
.TP
.BR v2.0.2\~ "released February 26, 2015"
Version 2.0.2 fixes SSSE3 problems.
.TP
.BR v2.0.1\~ "released February 26, 2015"
Version 2.0.1 is a development version that contains a partial
implementation of the fastidious option, but it is not usable yet.
.TP
.BR v2.0.0\~ "released December 3, 2014"
Version 2.0.0 is faster and easier to use, providing new output
options (\-\-internal\-structure and \-\-log), new control options
(\-\-boundary, \-\-fastidious, \-\-no\-otu\-breaking), and built-in
OTU refinement (no need to use the python script anymore). When using
default parameters, a novel and considerably faster algorithmic
approach is used, guaranteeing \fBswarm\fR's scalability.
.TP
.BR v1.2.21\~ "released February 26, 2015"
Version 1.2.21 is supposed to fix some problems related to the use of
the SSSE3 CPU instructions which are not always available.
.TP
.BR v1.2.20\~ "released November 6, 2014"
Version 1.2.20 presents a production-ready version of the alternative
algorithm (option \-a), with optional built-in OTU breaking (option
\-n). That alternative algorithmic approach (usable only with \fId\fR
= 1) is considerably faster than currently used clustering algorithms,
and can deal with datasets of 100 million unique amplicons or more in
a few hours. Of course, results are rigourously identical to the
results previously produced with swarm. That release also introduces
new options to control swarm output (options \-i and \-l).
.TP
.BR v1.2.19\~ "released October 3, 2014"
Version 1.2.19 fixes a problem related to abundance information when
the sequence identifier includes multiple underscore characters.
.TP
.BR v1.2.18\~ "released September 29, 2014"
Version 1.2.18 reenables the possibility of reading sequences from
\fIstdin\fR if no file name is specified on the command line. It also
fixes a bug related to CPU features detection.
.TP
.BR v1.2.17\~ "released September 28, 2014"
Version 1.2.17 fixes a memory allocation bug introduced in version
1.2.15.
.TP
.BR v1.2.16\~ "released September 27, 2014"
Version 1.2.16 fixes a bug in the abundance sort introduced in version
1.2.15.
.TP
.BR v1.2.15\~ "released September 27, 2014"
Version 1.2.15 sorts the input sequences in order of decreasing
abundance unless they are detected to be sorted already. When using
the alternative algorithm for \fId\fR = 1 it also sorts all subseeds
in order of decreasing abundance.
.TP
.BR v1.2.14\~ "released September 27, 2014"
Version 1.2.14 fixes a bug in the output with the \-\-swarm_breaker
option (\-b) when using the alternative algorithm (\-a).
.TP
.BR v1.2.12\~ "released August 18, 2014"
Version 1.2.12 introduces an option \-\-alternative\-algorithm to use
an extremely fast, experimental clustering algorithm for the special
case \fId\fR = 1. Multithreading scalability of the default algorithm
has been noticeably improved.
.TP
.BR v1.2.10\~ "released August 8, 2014"
Version 1.2.10 allows amplicon abundances to be specified using the
usearch style in the sequence header (e.g. ">id;size=1") when the \-z
option is chosen.
.TP
.BR v1.2.8\~ "released August 5, 2014"
Version 1.2.8 fixes an error with the gap extension penalty. Previous
versions used a gap penalty twice as large as intended. That bug
correction induces small changes in clustering results.
.TP
.BR v1.2.6\~ "released May 23, 2014"
Version 1.2.6 introduces an option \-\-mothur to output clustering
results in a format compatible with the microbial ecology community
analysis software suite Mothur (<http://www.mothur.org/>).
.TP
.BR v1.2.5\~ "released April 11, 2014"
Version 1.2.5 removes the need for a POPCNT hardware instruction to be
present. \fBswarm\fR now automatically checks whether POPCNT is
available and uses a slightly slower software implementation if
not. Only basic SSE2 instructions are now required to run \fBswarm\fR.
.TP
.BR v1.2.4\~ "released January 30, 2014"
Version 1.2.4 introduces an option \-\-break\-swarms to output all
pairs of amplicons with \fId\fR differences to standard error. That
option is used by the companion script `swarm_breaker.py` to refine
\fBswarm\fR results. The syntax of the inline assembly code is changed
for compatibility with more compilers.
.TP
.BR v1.2\~ "released May 16, 2013"
Version 1.2 greatly improves speed by using alignment-free comparisons
of amplicons based on \fIk\fR-mer word content. For each amplicon, the
presence-absence of all possible 5-mers is computed and recorded in a
1024-bits vector. Vector comparisons are extremely fast and
drastically reduce the number of costly pairwise alignments performed
by \fBswarm\fR. While remaining exact, \fBswarm\fR 1.2 can be more
than 100-times faster than \fBswarm\fR 1.1, when using a single thread
with a large set of sequences. The minor version 1.1.1, published just
before, adds compatibility with Apple computers, and corrects an issue
in the pairwise global alignment step that could lead to sub-optimal
alignments.
.TP
.BR v1.1\~ "released February 26, 2013"
Version 1.1 introduces two new important options: the possibility to
output clustering results using the uclust output format, and the
possibility to output detailed statistics on each OTU. \fBswarm\fR 1.1
is also faster: new filterings based on pairwise amplicon sequence
lengths and composition comparisons reduce the number of pairwise
alignments needed and speed up the clustering.
.TP
.BR v1.0\~ "released November 10, 2012"
First public release.

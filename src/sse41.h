#ifdef __x86_64__
#ifdef __SSE4_1__

/*
  SSE4.1 specific code for x86-64

  Only include if __SSE4_1__ is defined, which is done by the
  gcc compiler when the -msse4.1 option or similar is given.

  This code requires the _mm_min_epu16 intrinsic implemented
  with the PMINUW instruction on the CPU. That instruction was
  available starting with the Penryn architecture in 2008.
